Hi there and this is the first entery of this project.
I will fix things later and make it more readable (untill then read the raw text in this document).

To recape who I'm for those randomly stumble over this project.
Hi I goes by EH-Sora online (with some variation on it) and tries to be better at using GitHub.

I'm Swedish and has ADHD and dyslexia, so English isn't my native languge.
But I basiclly almost fluent in English.

I'm 27 at the moment and studyed game design in high school.
I'm a bit broken for only be 27 and have a physical demanding job.

I'm currently trying to pick up game desing again becouse I really enjoyed it when I was in high school.
And today I'm picking game development again to keep the gears turning and as well learning diffrent programing languages, like COBOL to learn and for shits and giggles


With that said back to the main topic.
This is just a small game project to see what I remember and to see how I have forgotten in game design/ development by recreating my old Gymnasiearbete from high school (Final high school project) to have a bit of a benchmark or a base line on my current knowlage lays at today.

The reason I will recreate my old Gymnasiearbete (Final high school project) is it's basiclly a side scroller with the ground crudlly spawn and respawn the ground.

The player is just a stretched out cube that can only move right and left, as well jumpping, so 3 keys to play and a key for the pause menu.
The enimies are just a red cube that kill the player on contact.
Basic menus and screens

And that's it for the game.


At the moment is to install Unity and refreash my memory a bit and keep track what I remember and what I needed to look online (at least try to)

The main "work machine" is a beatup (more well used) mid 2012 13" unibody MacBook Pro running EndeavorOS with Gnome (I'm working on getting Hyprland more optimaized and running more smoother)

I will need to fix one of the CMD keys and deep clean it and and repaste the thearmal past when I'm open it up.
And I will consider the fixing of the mid 2012 13" unibody MacBook Pro as part of this project as a bit of a footnote.

I will try to remember to add rough time stamps when I started writing a entery in this document and as well a rough end to keep track when I stopped writting to have a bit split in what I'm doing and through the day and a way to see what I did or think during a specific time or date.

A another thing is this document will be a bit wierdly formated to be mainly easier for me to read (due to dyslexia and the text flows togaver)

With that said I will add a blur when Unity is installed.
