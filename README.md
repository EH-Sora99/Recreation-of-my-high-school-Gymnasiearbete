# Recreation of my high school Gymnasiearbete
***Fix the README.md as I go***

Hi and wellcome to another GitHub project from me.
This is just a fun project to see how much of what I remember from my time in high school and what I have forgot in the 6-7 years since I actively worked in Unity.

This will be a rough version on what I remember from memory and look around my Google Drive, iCloud and external hard drives.

I have found almost everything exapt of the GDD (Game Design Document).
I will try to make this playable on:
* MacOS
* Linux (Appimage)
* Windows (I don't have any windows computer to test with)?
* Web (maybe)

Things To-Do
* Make a TO-DO.md
* Fix the README.md
* Find the GDD
  * Make a new GDD  
* Install Unity
* Make a rough test "level"
* Figure out how to document
*
